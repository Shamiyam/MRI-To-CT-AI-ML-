# MRI-To-CT-AI-ML-
This is the capstone project for the Minor-AI/ML Datascience course from IIT Mandi * Masai, I would first like to Thanks my Guide for this project Munish Sir!!
We had options to choose project that required using the knowledge and skill gained/learned during the course which would be really insightful.

I am always thankful to all the Faculties of IIT Mandi who taught me during the course.Specifically Gurprit Sir for making me fall in love with Maths, Indu Joshi Mam for her interactive session for both Maths and AI/ML, Aditya Sir for his intution and working of Different AI/ML methods, Ankit Sir who took Mentor sessions and cleared our Maths doubts as well as any other doubt we had.

I am thankful to Ankur Sir and Dibya mam and all the people behind it for the wonderful help and support for making this course a success for me and the curious ones.
